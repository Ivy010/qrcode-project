## My process
- Setup: Started by structuring the basic HTML5 skeleton and inserting the QR code image.

- Styling: Crafted the card layout using plain CSS, focusing on clean, minimalistic styling.

- Centering: Faced challenges with centering the card both horizontally and vertically; tried different methods like flexbox and margin auto techniques.

- Refinement: Focused on subtle details like padding, border-radius, and box-shadow to give the card a polished look.


### Built with
- HTML
- CSS3


### What I learned
- Structuring Clean HTML: Understood the importance of semantic HTML structure for simple styling.
- CSS Basics: Realized how small tweaks(like align-items: center) can dramatically change layouts.

### Continued development
- CSS Mastery: I want to deepen my skills in CSS layout techniques to make building responsive designs feel more natural and less frustrating.

- Component Building: Start building slightly more complex components (like interactive cards, modals, or simple forms) to sharpen both design and structure skills.
